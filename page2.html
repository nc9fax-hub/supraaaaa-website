    <h1 style="color:whitesmoke"><mark>1. 😲Self-awareness🧭</mark></h1>
    <h2 style="color:whitesmoke"><ul>
        <li>Track your time for 2 to 3 days by using an app to log how you actually spend your time. For example, using the screen time option that is inside your phone's settings option.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Identify time leaks by spotting patterns such as getting distracted on social media, overstudying subjects or commuting</li>
    </ul></h2>
    <h1 style="color:whitesmoke"><mark>2. ⏱️Apply the 3-Tier Task system🧭</mark></h1>
    <h2 style="color:whitesmoke"><ul>
        Label your task as:
        <br>
        <br>
            <dd>Tier 1 = Must complete today(urgent and important)</dd>
            <dd>Tier 2 = Should do soon(not urgent but important)</dd>
            <dd>Tier 3 = Should do when there's free time(low priority)</dd>

        <br>
        This will ensure students or young adults prevent spending hours on tier 3 tasks while ignoring tier 1
